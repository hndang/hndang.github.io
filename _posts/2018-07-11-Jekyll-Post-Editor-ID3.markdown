<p>During my time creating a Website using Jekyll frame work, I found myself spending alot of time on trivial matters when creating a post. I thought then that making an application to do this work will be much better. I could even make is so that it's has a the GUI for a easy to use website generator that non technical user like my mom could use.</p>
<p>I just release my version one of the software at my github:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hndang/Jekyll-Post-Editor">https://github.com/hndang/Jekyll-Post-Editor</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This is my first iteration of the software that include the basic functionality such as name, date, front matter generator. It also include a html preview, which I would like to upgrade it to a full fledge html editor generator in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One thing I've done that I really like is that the front matter UI is generated base on the template text file:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There's still things I could improve but I'm pretty happy with the result for 3 days' work. Hopefully, more people will find this project useful for creating their website.</p>
